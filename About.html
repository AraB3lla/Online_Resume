        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>My Passions and Personality</h2>
        <p>I have many passions but most of them fall under the category of creativity and self-expression.
            These passions include painting, sketching, and music as well as my community within this genre.
            I am very passionate about technology and curious about how certain things work, such as AI and
            Animation.
        </p>
        <p>Personality wise, I am always full of ideas even if they don't work properly yet. I am always
            looking for people to speak to about something new I've learnt or want to implement. I am a loud, bubbly,
            and unique person. </p>

        <h2>My Work Ethic</h2>
        <p>I have been told I bring energy and enthusiasm to the work place. I am a perfectionist when it comes to my
            work and will spend hours/days making sure that every part is working smoothly.I am a fast learner and
            always strive to do my best in every task I do.</p>

        <h2>How I got here</h2>
        <p>I started doing coding in high school, it was very much the basics but i enjoyed creating something that
            seemed impossible before. After high school I started styling my before boring websites in CSS3 and later
            decided that I needed some hands on help, persuing my dreams. That's when i decided to go to CodeSpace
            Academy and I learnt everything i know to do to be an asset to a polential employer.</p>
